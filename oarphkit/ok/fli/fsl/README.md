This module contains a standard suite of Functors included in FLi. Highlights:

  * Higher-order Functors: (Composition)[Composition.hpp] for composing / 
      chaining Functors, (While)[While.hpp] for running a Functor in a loop,
      and (Stream)[Stream.hpp] for applying Functors to streaming data.
  * (FSLShell)[FSLShell.hpp]: A shell-like
      (Subroutine)[../Core/Functors/Subroutine.hpp] that facilitates common
